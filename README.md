The Leuphana Community App i designed, helps students at Leuphana University stay connected and access important resources easily. It includes sections like the Information Hub, Community Forum with a chatbot, Well-being Resources, and Community Connections. The app is designed to be user-friendly with a clean interface and clear navigation. I developed it based on student survey and feedback, it continues to evolve to meet the needs of the students in the university community.
